# NewtonsRing
Investigate what effects the incidence angle and wavelength of the light, the material and curvature of the lenses, and the distance between the planoconvex lens and the optical flat glass has on the shape and size of the Newtonâ€™s rings produced.

# Matlab simulation:
Using the program and get the simulation value of r_n.
Type in the value of the parameters(wave length, curvature radius and air thickness) in the program and get the correspond pictures.
